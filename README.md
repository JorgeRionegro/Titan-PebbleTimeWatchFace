# Titan-PebbleTimeWatchFace
My first Watchface for Pebbe (Analog Style with Hands shadows if you want¡¡¡) (ready for Pebble Time)
Include battery level (with square blocks) and lost of bluetooth signal (circle over battery).

Was made searching from other pebble wathchfaces and resources from GitHub community or tutorials from Pebble.

Thanks to all of you people ¡¡¡¡

You can configure:
 - 12 different Kind of clocks (Colors)
 - 3 different hand Types
 - Seconds hand (on/off)
 - Hands shadows (on/off)
 - Bluetooth Advise (on/off)
 - Zoom ratio (bigger or smaller watch)
 - Numers display type (not developed yet)
 

Trying also to develop some antialiasing solution but still does´nt works correctly...
